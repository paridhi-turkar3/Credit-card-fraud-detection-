# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Credit Card Fraud Detection

## 📌 Problem Description
Credit card fraud is one of the most pressing challenges in the financial industry. With millions of transactions occurring daily, detecting fraudulent activities in real-time is critical to safeguard customers and financial institutions. The **highly imbalanced nature of fraud data** (fraudulent transactions being less than 0.2% of total transactions) makes the problem complex and requires careful exploration before modeling.

This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the underlying data patterns, identify anomalies, and highlight relationships among features that could be crucial for building fraud detection systems.

## 💡 Project Idea
The main idea of this project is to:
- Explore the **Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset** from Kaggle.
- Perform **descriptive and visual analytics** to understand distributions, correlations, and anomalies.
- Identify how fraud differs from non-fraud transactions in terms of time, amount, and hidden features.
- Generate insights that can help data scientists and financial institutions build better **fraud detection models**.

## ⚙️ Implementation
The project was implemented in the following stages:

1. **Data Acquisition**
   - Downloaded dataset from Kaggle: [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
   - Loaded into Google Colab for analysis.

2. **Data Exploration**
   - Checked dataset structure (`.info()`, `.describe()`)
   - Verified missing/null values.
   - Examined class distribution (fraud vs non-fraud).

3. **Data Visualization**
   - Fraud vs Non-Fraud count plots.
   - Transaction amount distributions.
   - Time-based fraud transaction analysis.
   - Correlation heatmap of all features.
   - Outlier detection using boxplots.

4. **Insights & Summary**
   - Discovered strong data imbalance.
   - Identified significant correlations with fraud (e.g., features `V14`, `V17`).
   - Observed that fraudulent transactions occur more frequently during specific times.
   - Outliers in transaction amounts could indicate fraudulent activity.

- Dataset is **clean (no missing values)**.
- **Fraud transactions** show unique patterns in terms of time and amount.
- Certain anonymized features (e.g., `V14`, `V17`) strongly correlate with fraudulent activity.
- Outlier detection shows large, unusual transaction amounts linked to fraud.
